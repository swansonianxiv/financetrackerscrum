# financetrackerscrum
Stated Objective For Scrum Project 1

This application is intended to allow users to manage their money, combining banking features with personal finance tools. The interface should be simple and allow users to track spending, budget, and set and reach goals all from the app.
 
With updates, personalised content , and helpful notifications, the app will allow users to save time and reduce financial stress. Unless we are unable to do any of these things, in which case this goal will probaby be shifted so we can meet it, like the winners we are.
